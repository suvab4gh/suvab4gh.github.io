## Projects

1. **Early Detection of Poultry Diseases Using IoT & Sensors**
   *(Team Project | Arduino, Raspberry Pi, MQ-135, DHT11, LEDs)*
   - Designed an IoT-based ammonia detection system to monitor poultry farm air quality and detect early signs of diseases like avian influenza.
   - Integrated MQ-135 gas sensor and DHT11 (humidity/temperature) with Arduino Uno to measure ammonia levels (5–300 ppm) and environmental factors.
   - Programmed color-coded LED alerts (Green/Yellow/Red) for real-time feedback; reduced manual monitoring by 70%.
   - Achieved 95% accuracy in correlating ammonia spikes with metabolic disorders in birds.
   - Outcome: Published in university thesis; potential to reduce farm losses by 40% through early intervention.

2. **ECG-Based Personalized Workout & Recovery Tracker with Biohaptic Feedback**
   *(Team Project | ECG Sensors, Python, AI, Embedded Systems)*
   - Developed a wearable device using ECG sensors to monitor heart activity and provide real-time biohaptic feedback during workouts.
   - Implemented AI algorithms (Python) to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) and VO2 max for personalized recovery insights.
   - Integrated vibration motors for haptic alerts to prevent overexertion; improved workout efficiency by 30%.
   - Collaborated on a shortlisted prototype for MLH Hackathon (Global Hack Week: Web3).

3. **Arduino Uno-Based System Design from Scratch**
   *(Individual Project | Circuit Design, C Programming)*
   - Built a custom Arduino Uno setup for IoT applications, including Veroboard design, sensor integration, and power management.
   - Programmed sensor data acquisition and actuator control logic in C; reduced component costs by 25% using open-source tools.
